# Description

A password generator made using CSS, HTML, and Javascript. This was my first time trying to make a project at this size, albeit small. I learned a lot doing this project.

# Challenges Faced

It was difficult coming up with a way to get the password generator to act right, especially if a person checks a box and then unchecks it. I came up with a roundabout way that involved multiple arrays and resettings things here and there.

# Future Changes

I hope to one day come back to this code and clean it up, especially the CSS. I'd also like to implement some new features in the future.
